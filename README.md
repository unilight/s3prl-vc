## Introduction and motivation

[S3PRL](https://github.com/s3prl/s3prl) stands for "Self-Supervised Speech/Sound Pre-training and Representation Learning Toolkit". It is a toolkit for benchmarking self-supervised speech representations (S3Rs) models using a collection of so-called "downstream" tasks. S3PRL-VC was originally built under S3PRL, which implements voice conversion (VC) as one of the downstream tasks. However, as S3PRL grows bigger and bigger, it is getting harder to integrate the various VC recipes into the main S3PRL repository. Therefore, this repository aims to isolate the VC downstream task from S3PRL to become an independently-maintained toolkit (hopefully).

## What can this repo do?

This repo aims to provide **a platform for frame-based recognition-synthesis voice conversion**.

### Pipeline

Given a source speech, we first use a recognizer (or upstream) to extract intermediate representations, which are then mapped to the acoustic feature space (log melspectrograms) with a synthesizer (or downstream). Finally a waveform synthesizer (some call it vocoder) is used to convert the acoustic feature to waveform.

### Supported upstream

Currently the supported S3R upstream completely depend on the official [S3PRL](https://s3prl.github.io/s3prl/tutorial/upstream_collection.html) repository. In addition, we also provide two PPG models: `ppg_sxliu` uses the ASR model provided by [Songxiang Liu's ppg-vc repo](https://github.com/liusongxiang/ppg-vc), and `ppg_whisper` uses the [OpenAI Whisper ASR model](https://github.com/openai/whisper). Note that in my experiments, the Whisper model yields very bad results, but I don't know what the reason is. I would appreciate it if someone could figure out why.

## Installation 

### 1. (Recommended) Editable installation with virtualenv 

This repo is designed for research purposes, so it is recommended to install in this fashion.

```
git clone https://github.com/unilight/s3prl-vc.git
cd s3prl-vc/tools
make
```

### 2. pip

For my own other research projects (which might be publicized in the future), I needed this repo as a standalone toolkit. So I also made command-line entries, which can be installed like this:

```
pip install s3prl-vc
```

## Complete training, decoding and benchmarking

Same as many speech processing based repositories ([ESPNet](https://github.com/espnet/espnet), [ParallelWaveGAN](https://github.com/kan-bayashi/ParallelWaveGAN), etc.), we formulate our recipes in kaldi-style. They can be found in the `egs` folder. Please check the detailed usage in each recipe.
